38,Netherlands,SyRi,Enforcement,https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/,1- National,"Various municipalities in the Netherlands have been using the SyRi system to detect welfare fraud more effectively. SyRi has been developed by the Dutch government and uses various risk indicators from existing governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more, in order to detect which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. To enable the sharing of different information items that are relevant for SyRi, the system operates on a legal basis which clearly indicates which kind of data can be captured, stored and shared.The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations.   Various organisations have opposed the usage of the system. They argue that it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. The UN-rapporteur for Human Rights also expressed his concerns on the use of SyRi as it could be a significant threat to human rights. Some projects revealed significant difficulties in integrating various data sources, which caused the recommendations by the system to become outdated and in fact unusable. In municipalities where the system actually gave recommendations on possible fraudulent behaviour, the success rate was very low. As, the costs of SyRi have been estimated to be over 325.000 euro per year, so that many have been wondering whether the system was worth the privacy and financial costs at all.   Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR (European Convention of Human Rights), thus its usage has been cancelled. The judge ruled that the collective, economic welfare interest of preventing fraud weighed insufficiently against the social interest of privacy. Furthermore, the absence of disclosure about the inner working of SyRi makes its usage insufficiently transparent and verifiable.

55,Spain,VeriPol,Enforcement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095070511830128X,1- National,"The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes. This practice is regarded as quite troublesome, as it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police resources and is often used in combination with other fraudulent behaviour. Recently, the Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol, an AI system in order to detect false police reports. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. Its development was the result of a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff, the Charles III University of Madrid and the Spanish National Police. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers of the universities in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports. VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports. For example, pilot studies found that false police reports are more likely to include shorter statements, focused on the objects which were stolen and lacking details. Following the development, the system was tested in pilot situations in both the police department of Malaga and Murcia. These pilots have been regarded as successful because an increase in the number of false reports was detected. Furthermore, an anonymous survey among the staff showed that the VeriPol system was useful, easy to use but should include more functionalities to detect other forms of crime. Now the system has been rolled out for use by all the departments of the Spanish National Police. The expected impact of the use of the system is to both detect false reports early, leaving more police resources available to focus on other tasks and reports, while at the same time deterring people from filing fake statements in the first place. An additional benefit of the system is to gain more insights into how people lie to police officers as well as to gain more knowledge in detecting true and false police reports.

56,Sweden,Automated social welfare decisions in Trelleborg,Adjudication,https://valcon.com/insights/trelleborg-robotics-solution/,3- Local,"In the municipality of Trelleborg, AI technologies are used to automate various social assistance decisions since 2016. It was the first municipality to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle various applications on social assistance. At the moment, the automated decision making system is able to process applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and has been regarded as a successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits. Previously, employees had to manually assess the applications which took considerable amounts of time and costs. With more than 300 applications on social benefits in the municipality every month, citizens sometimes had to wait an average of 8 days on the decision on their welfare-payments, which sometimes leading up to 20 days. As a result of this waiting time, citizens would frequently contact the department about their applications, further increasing the workload of the staff. The decision to use AI to improve the welfare payment process was thought limit the waiting time and consequently various worries of payment delivery by citizens.  Any rejected applications are still handled by people themselves. The automation of the welfare services was not possible if there was not already an online process for people to submit their welfare applications to. In 2015, Trelleborg was the first Swedish municipality to digitalize their administration on social benefits. Already 75% of the citizens used the online platform to access welfare payments which enabled significant data and information to automate this process with RPA technology. Without the data coming from the self-service portal, it would not have been possible to automate these processes. Valcon, a consultancy, helped to develop and implement the RPA platform. As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration could be allocated to spend more time on other, value adding tasks such as handling more complex cases.

Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the agency has not used resumes in their recruitment process and growingly taken an interest in data-driven recruitment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot was regarded as the next step in preventing biases in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to neutralise any psycho-social prejudices. The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. For the company this was also a first time, the municipal recruitment and staffing agency being their first public sector client. The Tengai robot is seen to complement the recruitment process nicely, having been designed not to perceive the age, gender, clothing, background or other looks of interviewed persons. The municipality is using Tengai to first identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. Here, Tengai works in collaboration with existing staff, as the recruiters analyse competency checks and schedule an interview appointment with Tengai. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores. Tengai then makes a first selection of promising candidates. The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation. The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment. According to one of the directors of the municipality, the Tengai robot has made the selection and hiring processes faster, cheaper and more unbiased, freeing up crucial resources to be spent on other tasks.
