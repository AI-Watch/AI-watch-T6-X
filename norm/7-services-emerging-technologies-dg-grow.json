Specifically, it sought to automate the review process for its FAstlane program. Smart contracts were deployed to automatically calculate the financial health score from vendors' balance sheets. The proof of concept also incorporated machine learning and robotic process automation to speed the collection and evaluation of information. Now, the organization is planning to scale up the application of these technologies to the entire 'Multiple Schedule Awards' program, of which 'FAstLane was a part.",

        "description": "The United Arab Emirates launched a blockchain strategy in 2018 that has set an aim to conduct 50% of all transactions at the federal level using blockchain technology by 2021. This comes after Dubai had launched a similar strategy in the context of its smart city initiative few years ago. A major way in which blockchain technology is estimated to save costs is through reducing dependence on document-based transactions. As procurement is one of the major functions of government departments, and also a document-intensive process, applications for the technology in procurement may be identified.",

Each municipality would be able to launch requests for tenders in the form of a smart contract. Potential suppliers can respond with their tenders (probably also in the form of a smart contract). Under this system, an automatic matching would be done between the requirements of the request for tender and the supplier's offer. The qualification\/disqualification process can be automated (and the buyer will not be able to see the price offer if the supplier is disqualified). The evaluation process could also be automated.

Their plan for doing this involves setting up a system whereby invoices are automatically sent over the Peppol network to both the consumer and to DIFI, which stores them in a single database. The first step is to test this concept, through a first pilot due this year. The idea is that eventually this data can be used to help automate various parts of the procurement process. One initial hypotheses on how this could be done is automated categorisation of the product types that are being procured. It is thought that the data could also be used to provide input into the state budget.",

ALICE, MONICA and SOFIA, are three automated tools that have been developed using the data from Labcontas. \n\n\nALICE performs a daily analysis of all bids from federal agencies. Each day, the results of its analysis are sent to TCU auditors by email, with the system flagging any abnormalities about the bids, for example requiring participants to obtain certificates that the TCU does not consider to be prerequisites.\n\nMeanwhile, MONICA is a panel providing the visualisation of public purchasing data, such as the suppliers that are most contracted and the types of service most used. Finally SOFIA is a tool that analyses the reports developed by auditors. It points out errors and suggests correlations and reference sources.",

The results of the beta test of this system were that 26% more tenders with unfounded selection of the winner were identified, 37% more tenders with groundless disqualification, and 298% more with participants\u2019 conspiracy. The system is intended to complement and support the work done by experts - making their work more efficient.",

        "description": "This research project used a neural network approach to predict public corruption based on economic and political factors, using data on actual cases of corruption. The model is applied to Spanish provinces in which actual cases of corruption were reported by the media or went to court between 2000 and 2012. The model finds that the taxation of real estate, economic growth, the increase in real estate prices, the growing number of deposit institutions and nonfinancial firms, and the same political party remaining in power for long periods seem to induce public corruption",

During the pilot phase data from twitter (as the data is open) is collected and analysed to provide quick feedback on how users react to new tenders etc. The system gives a positive, neutral or negative categorisation to the different sentiments expressed in the relevant tweets. The pilot is due to end in Summer 2018, with first results by the end of July. A decision on whether to scale up the pilot will be taken by September.

Data Embassy is an extension in the cloud of the Estonian government, which means the state owns server resources outside its territorial boundaries. This is an innovative concept for handling state information, since states usually store their information within their physical boundaries. Data Embassy resources are under Estonian state control. They are secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with Blockchain technology and are capable of not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services.",

The system is well used in cities; however the algorithm does not yet work well in rural areas. \nThe Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm. \nEstonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control. \nIn line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia\u2019s economy and state.",
