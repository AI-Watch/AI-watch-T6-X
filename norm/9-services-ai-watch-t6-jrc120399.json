        "description": "Digital participation platforms are important tools for increasing citizen engagement and improving government responsiveness. However, analysing the high volumes of citizen input collected on these platforms is extremely time-consuming and daunting for city officials; this technical difficulty can keep them from uncovering valuable learnings. Setting up a digital participation platform therefore isn\u2019t enough: it\u2019s also necessary to make data analysis more accessible so that civil servants can tap into collective intelligence and make better informed decisions. The challenge of automation we have been faced with as a civic tech company is shared by the public sector at large. CitizenLab aims to bridge the knowledge gap that currently exists in the public sector.The platform administrators have access to all of this information at a glance in intelligent, real- time dashboards. The topic modelling makes it easy to see what the citizen\u2019s priorities are, and to make decisions accordingly. The CitizenLab Platform is in use in over 200 local authorities which are likely to use some of the elements of the AI to analyse volumes of citizen input.",

To do this, they compare the text of the files of the offer to the ones of the metadata of the components.

        "description": "In 2014, the Flemish Agency for Child and Family (Kind en Gezin) developed an AI system which enables more accurate predictions to detect day-care services which require further inspection. These inspections enable the agencies to keep the quality of the day-care services high and to improve the wellbeing of children. The Child and Family agency does not carry out the inspections itself but works together with the Regional Health Care Inspection Unit of the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family.  However, there is limited capacity available to conduct all the inspections. For a long period of time, there has been an interest to figure out how to optimise the inspection capacity. The use of data had been considered as way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors. The predictive system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGBoost) to analyse various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection Unit. Combining the recommendations of the predictive system with existing staff experience and expertise enables more targeted and data-driven interventions.",

        "description": "In the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board (ARIB), AI is used in order to detect whether the agricultural grasslands have been mowed or not using image recognition. This system, called SATIKAS , uses deep learning methods and convolutional neural network approaches to analyse the satellite data coming from the European COPERNICUS programme to automatically detect whether mowing has taken place on the Estonian grasslands. The optical satellite images from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the government in Estonia. The SATIKAS system is still under development and will expand its features and capabilities in the near future. While at the moment the system is able to detect mowing of grass, in the future it will be used for identifying different types of crops and trees as well.",

If Iti does not know the answer, it will redirect the query based on its content to either the customer support specialist of the data provider or the user of the statistics. Iti has obtained its knowledge from the questions sent through online chats over one year and gets wiser with every query. The number of information requests that Statistics Estonia (the government agency responsible for producing official statistics regarding Estonia) receives is increasing year by year.

The objective is to dynamically detect 2 to 5 new SMEs per month on the scale of Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9. Expected impacts in terms of digital transformation: an even more effective decentralized State action to support weakened companies. Ultimately, it is a real \u201csecure social network\u201d centered on the company which will become the daily tool of public actors mobilized around companies in difficulty .Initiated in 2014 on a very local scale, the national deployment of Weak Signals was approved on April 3, 2019 thanks to the signing of an agreement by the historical partners of the project.

        "description": "In early 2018, the Irish Revenue Commissioners began investigating the potential of Artificial Intelligence to provide a more efficient, effective experience for customers using their telephony services. A pilot project was initiated to examine if AI based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies could be used to deliver an improved customer service, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) or voicebot which was designed to focus on a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. On a daily basis, taxpayers contact Irish Revenue tax clearance customer support asking how to apply for tax clearance; enquiring what their current tax clearance status is; requesting more information on expired, refused & rescinded tax clearance applications as well as just looking for information on tax clearance itself. It is reported that currently, up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot,  70% of first-time applicants engaged with the voicebot when submitting their application, 75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN). Only in 10% of the calls, the calls were transferred to a human operator due to the inability of the voicebot to understand the request.",

This can assist local authorities to better understand how local people feel about civic issues.  The resulting analysis based on the gathered online data is presented via visual dashboards and through monthly reports provided online. The different reports give an overview of key issues such as how people feel about environmental issues, cultural events or city region developments expressed on the online media. The Dublin Beat can help local authorities to better understand how citizens feel about key issues and ensure that civic efforts and policy reflect the needs of communities. But of course, it is important to note that these insights are indicative only of the sentiments expressed by a cohort of citizens who use social media. Local authorities employ other methods to ensure truly inclusive citizen engagement.",

UNA is able to answer frequently asked questions about the registration of their businesses as well as the liquidation, merchants, companies and organizations. If citizens already have an application in progress, they are also able to ask about the progress of their documents. At the moment, UNA only works in the Latvian language.  A Latvian company, Tilde, specializing in AI technologies cooperated in the development of UNA. The usage of the conversational agent has been argued to be highly successful and has been nominated for numerous awards such as the OECD's Public Excellence, World Summit Awards and others. According to the first performance indicators, 44% of the questions asked on UNA are considered to be general of nature and easily taken care of by the Chatbot.",

SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. To enable the sharing of different information items that are relevant for SyRi, the system operates on a legal basis which clearly indicates which kind of data can be captured, stored and shared.The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations.   Various organisations have opposed the usage of the system. They argue that it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. The UN-rapporteur for Human Rights also expressed his concerns on the use of SyRi as it could be a significant threat to human rights. Some projects revealed significant difficulties in integrating various data sources, which caused the recommendations by the system to become outdated and in fact unusable. In municipalities where the system actually gave recommendations on possible fraudulent behaviour, the success rate was very low. As, the costs of SyRi have been estimated to be over 325.000 euro per year, so that many have been wondering whether the system was worth the privacy and financial costs at all.   Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR (European Convention of Human Rights), thus its usage has been cancelled. The judge ruled that the collective, economic welfare interest of preventing fraud weighed insufficiently against the social interest of privacy. Furthermore, the absence of disclosure about the inner working of SyRi makes its usage insufficiently transparent and verifiable.",

Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible to find almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. The solution is also used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries.  In the work on developing this solution, the MFA cooperated with the University of Oslo, which provided solutions for categorising the Norwegian language.

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline. The government intends to add more functionality to the app over time.",

This software works by using artificial intelligence sensors that are installed in streetlights. Then, virtual grids are created in which there is a maximum capacity for occupants.  The 3D volume of people entering and leaving these spaces is measured, as well as the amount of people entering the measurement grids. The results of the calculations are carried out in real time in order to warn citizens about means of occupancy (percentages and colours are used as visual warnings).",

        "description": "The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes. This practice is regarded as quite troublesome, as it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police resources and is often used in combination with other fraudulent behaviour. Recently, the Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol, an AI system in order to detect false police reports. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. Its development was the result of a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff, the Charles III University of Madrid and the Spanish National Police. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers of the universities in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports. VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports. For example, pilot studies found that false police reports are more likely to include shorter statements, focused on the objects which were stolen and lacking details. Following the development, the system was tested in pilot situations in both the police department of Malaga and Murcia. These pilots have been regarded as successful because an increase in the number of false reports was detected. Furthermore, an anonymous survey among the staff showed that the VeriPol system was useful, easy to use but should include more functionalities to detect other forms of crime. Now the system has been rolled out for use by all the departments of the Spanish National Police. The expected impact of the use of the system is to both detect false reports early, leaving more police resources available to focus on other tasks and reports, while at the same time deterring people from filing fake statements in the first place. An additional benefit of the system is to gain more insights into how people lie to police officers as well as to gain more knowledge in detecting true and false police reports.",

        "description": "In the municipality of Trelleborg, AI technologies are used to automate various social assistance decisions since 2016. It was the first municipality to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle various applications on social assistance. At the moment, the automated decision making system is able to process applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and has been regarded as a successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits. Previously, employees had to manually assess the applications which took considerable amounts of time and costs. With more than 300 applications on social benefits in the municipality every month, citizens sometimes had to wait an average of 8 days on the decision on their welfare-payments, which sometimes leading up to 20 days. As a result of this waiting time, citizens would frequently contact the department about their applications, further increasing the workload of the staff. The decision to use AI to improve the welfare payment process was thought limit the waiting time and consequently various worries of payment delivery by citizens.  Any rejected applications are still handled by people themselves. The automation of the welfare services was not possible if there was not already an online process for people to submit their welfare applications to. In 2015, Trelleborg was the first Swedish municipality to digitalize their administration on social benefits. Already 75% of the citizens used the online platform to access welfare payments which enabled significant data and information to automate this process with RPA technology. Without the data coming from the self-service portal, it would not have been possible to automate these processes. Valcon, a consultancy, helped to develop and implement the RPA platform. As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration could be allocated to spend more time on other, value adding tasks such as handling more complex cases.",

        "description": "The Swedish municipality of Upplands-Bro has started experimenting with the robot Tengai in their recruitment processes since June 2019. Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the agency has not used resumes in their recruitment process and growingly taken an interest in data-driven recruitment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot was regarded as the next step in preventing biases in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to neutralise any psycho-social prejudices. The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. For the company this was also a first time, the municipal recruitment and staffing agency being their first public sector client. The Tengai robot is seen to complement the recruitment process nicely, having been designed not to perceive the age, gender, clothing, background or other looks of interviewed persons. The municipality is using Tengai to first identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. Here, Tengai works in collaboration with existing staff, as the recruiters analyse competency checks and schedule an interview appointment with Tengai. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores. Tengai then makes a first selection of promising candidates. The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation. The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment. According to one of the directors of the municipality, the Tengai robot has made the selection and hiring processes faster, cheaper and more unbiased, freeing up crucial resources to be spent on other tasks.",

        "description": "A predictive system called the \"Early Help Profiling System (EHPS)\" used in Hackney County (London), which uses data from a variety of different sources to identify children and families considered vulnerable and at risk of child abuse to the municipality. The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.   Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme.  Now Hackney Council stopped working with the programme as it did not realise the expected benefits.",

This is the start of a pilot project to analyse the usefulness of a project created for the challenge \u2018Improving the quality of life of senior citizens through technology\u2019, launched by the Barcelona Mobile World Capital Foundation. Users will be selected to live with a robot during a trial period. The pilot aims to discover to which extent the quality of life for senior citizens can be improved through assistance with a social robot, by, for example, reducing isolation, monitoring their health, preventing the forgetting of medicine or appointments.
