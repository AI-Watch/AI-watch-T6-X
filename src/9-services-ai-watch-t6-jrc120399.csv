3,Project Verontrustingen ,Enforcement,https://www.dialogic.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VTOM-Small-Kids-Big-Data-Frank-Bongers-mei-2018.pdf,,"In 2014, the Flemish Agency for Child and Family (Kind en Gezin) developed an AI system which enables more accurate predictions to detect day-care services which require further inspection. These inspections enable the agencies to keep the quality of the day-care services high and to improve the wellbeing of children. The Child and Family agency does not carry out the inspections itself but works together with the Regional Health Care Inspection Unit of the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family.  However, there is limited capacity available to conduct all the inspections. For a long period of time, there has been an interest to figure out how to optimise the inspection capacity. The use of data had been considered as way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors. The predictive system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGBoost) to analyse various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection Unit. Combining the recommendations of the predictive system with existing staff experience and expertise enables more targeted and data-driven interventions.  During the development phase, the Agency worked closely together with the Data Science team of the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family because there was already some expertise in text mining therein. In addition, a close collaboration was established with the Health Care Inspection Unit as they provided the data to be used in the system. A small budget of the Child and Family Agency for IT data science projects was used, but employees had to work on the model in their spare time as volunteers.  Now, the system is valued by civil servants, but it was noticed that there was still a need to convince colleagues of the value of the model. In particular, staff had to be convinced that the use of the model was meant to empower them, not to replace their expertise or control their work. In the end, the combination of showing statistical proof of the validity of the system as well as an emphasis on supporting human workers, rather than replacing them, further improved the acceptance and support of the public sector end-users.  Another important insight from this case study is the need for public organisations to provide continuous maintenance of the model and the underlying data in order to make AI adoption permanent. The AI system has had constant maintenance and improvement of the model in order to ensure its accuracy and reliability: if this maintenance was ignored, the accuracy of the model might decrease, which would reduce trust in the model and in other future data related projects.

12,SATIKAS,Enforcement,https://kosmos.ut.ee/en/news/information-system-satikas-helps-detect-mowing-using-satellite-data,,"In the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board (ARIB), AI is used in order to detect whether the agricultural grasslands have been mowed or not using image recognition. This system, called SATIKAS , uses deep learning methods and convolutional neural network approaches to analyse the satellite data coming from the European COPERNICUS programme to automatically detect whether mowing has taken place on the Estonian grasslands. The optical satellite images from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the government in Estonia.  The mowing or grazing of the grasslands is one of the most mentioned requirements for all the different agricultural subsidies and has one of the highest amount of non-compliances in Estonia. Naturally, not all the fields could be inspected by manual labour, so in the last inspection for instance, only 5-6% of the cases were visited. Due to rising labour costs and regulatory requirements, an innovative solution using Artificial Intelligence was considered to optimize the inspection capacity and prevent farmers from missing the subsidy requirements.  While SATIKAS has been implemented since 2018 in ARIB, it originally started as a research project back in 2011 with the Observatory of the Tartu University. The development and implementation of the system was funded by the European Regional Development Fund to assist the development of public services with ICT. Various public and private actors have been working together in the development and adoption of the system within the ARIB organisation by sharing different data, sharing (machine learning) expertise and technological infrastructure to store the different data sets.  Civil servants working with the AI-system see the value of the system, although many were somewhat sceptical of the project at first, fearing the creation of a Big Brother state or the disappearance of jobs. However, after project pilots were conducted and trainings given, trust in the AI system has increased. The training had to ensure that the staff is aware that the system is not 100% reliable and have to combine their existing expertise with the recommendations of the AI. Furthermore, field inspectors have also realized that their jobs will not disappear but have changed as a result of the system.  The SATIKAS system is still under development and will expand its features and capabilities in the near future. While at the moment the system is able to detect mowing of grass, in the future it will be used for identifying different types of crops and trees as well.

31,SyRi,Enforcement,https://ai-watch.github.io/AI-watch-T6-X/,,"Various municipalities in the Netherlands have been using the SyRi system to detect welfare fraud more effectively. SyRi has been developed by the Dutch government and uses various risk indicators from existing governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more, in order to detect which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. To enable the sharing of different information items that are relevant for SyRi, the system operates on a legal basis which clearly indicates which kind of data can be captured, stored and shared. While the core aim for SyRi is to tackle welfare fraud and reduce misuse of public funding, during the development of the system, the Dutch government also mentioned that the administration costs of detecting welfare fraud could be reduced and citizens might be more hesitant to commit fraud if they know that a governmental system is watching them. These goals are related to the more generic purposes of Syri to improve social safety and liveability of neighbourhoods. This is why most implementations of SyRi have been conducted in specific, usually less developed and poorer, territorial areas. The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations.   Various organisations have opposed the usage of the system. They argue that it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. The UN-rapporteur for Human Rights also expressed his concerns on the use of SyRi as it could be a significant threat to human rights.  In addition, the actual benefits of using the system have been disputed as well. While several projects in Dutch municipalities used the recommendations by SyRi, they did not allow to detect new cases of fraud in the end. Some projects revealed significant difficulties in integrating various data sources, which caused the recommendations by the system to become outdated and in fact unusable. In municipalities where the system actually gave recommendations on possible fraudulent behaviour, the success rate was very low. As, the costs of SyRi have been estimated to be over 325.000 euro per year, so that many have been wondering whether the system was worth the privacy and financial costs at all.   Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR (European Convention of Human Rights), thus its usage has been cancelled. The judge ruled that the collective, economic welfare interest of preventing fraud weighed insufficiently against the social interest of privacy. Furthermore, the absence of disclosure about the inner working of SyRi makes its usage insufficiently transparent and verifiable.

44,VeriPol,Enforcement,https://ai-watch.github.io/AI-watch-T6-X/,,"The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes. This practice is regarded as quite troublesome, as it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police resources and is often used in combination with other fraudulent behaviour.  Recently the Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol, an AI system in order to detect false police reports. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. Its development was the result of a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff, the Charles III University of Madrid and the Spanish National Police. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers of the universities in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports.  VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports. For example, pilot studies found that false police reports are more likely to include shorter statements, focused on the objects which were stolen and lacking details. Following the development, the system was tested in pilot situations in both the police department of Malaga and Murcia. These pilots have been regarded as successful because an increase in the number of false reports was detected. Furthermore, an anonymous survey among the staff showed that the VeriPol system was useful, easy to use but should include more functionalities to detect other forms of crime.  Now the system has been rolled out for use by all the departments of the Spanish National Police. The expected impact of the use of the system is to both detect false reports early, leaving more police resources available to focus on other tasks and reports, while at the same time deterring people from filing fake statements in the first place. An additional benefit of the system is to gain more insights into how people lie to police officers as well as to gain more knowledge in detecting true and false police reports.

45,Automated social wefare decisions,Adjudication,https://valcon.com/insights/trelleborg-robotics-solution/,,"In the municipality of Trelleborg, AI technologies are used to automate various social assistance decisions since 2016. It was the first municipality to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle various applications on social assistance. At the moment, the automated decision making system is able to process applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and has been regarded as a successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits.  Previously, employees had to manually assess the applications which took considerable amounts of time and costs. With more than 300 applications on social benefits in the municipality every month, citizens sometimes had to wait an average of 8 days on the decision on their welfare-payments, which sometimes leading up to 20 days. As a result of this waiting time, citizens would frequently contact the department about their applications, further increasing the workload of the staff. The decision to use AI to improve the welfare payment process was thought limit the waiting time and consequently various worries of payment delivery by citizens.  Any rejected applications are still handled by people themselves.  The automation of the welfare services was not possible if there was not already an online process for people to submit their welfare applications to. In 2015, Trelleborg was the first Swedish municipality to digitalize their administration on social benefits. Already 75% of the citizens used the online platform to access welfare payments which enabled significant data and information to automate this process with RPA technology. Without the data coming from the self-service portal, it would not have been possible to automate these processes. Valcon, a consultancy, helped to develop and implement the RPA platform.  As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration could be allocated to spend more time on other, value adding tasks such as handling more complex cases. An early study on the use of the automation has found that there was a positive attitude from the staff towards the use of the AI-system as it made their work more effective and with more legal certainty.  Despite these positive effects, there are also concerns with the use of automation. Already at the start of the project initiation, many social workers were hesitant on using automation due to fears of losing jobs or passing on sensitive social tasks to computers. Other Swedish municipalities aiming to follow the automation of Trelleborg are also meeting resistance from some of their local staff to implement AI; even leading to some staff members to resign. Some case workers have illustrated that there is a strong need for trust of the automation process. If there is no trust in the use of AI, staff will be obliged to double check all processes, which might lead to a decrease in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, some have illustrated concerns on leaving some citizens more vulnerable when all processes are automated online as it will be more challenging to assess individual needs.  While the AI-system enabled various social welfare benefits decisions to be automated, many other processes of Trelleborg municipality still operate as a traditional bureaucracy. There are still many paper-based processes within the organisation which could lead to double documentation and inefficient processes, as well as existing software with very poor interfaces and usability. Automation and AI systems could hence strongly improve one specific process in government, but the complementarity with other organisational processes should not be forgotten.

Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the agency has not used resumes in their recruitment process and growingly taken an interest in data-driven recruitment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot was regarded as the next step in preventing biases in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to neutralise any psycho-social prejudices.  The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. For the company this was also a first time, the municipal recruitment and staffing agency being their first public sector client.  The Tengai robot is seen to complement the recruitment process nicely, having been designed not to perceive the age, gender, clothing, background or other looks of interviewed persons. The municipality is using Tengai to first identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. Here, Tengai works in collaboration with existing staff, as the recruiters analyse competency checks and schedule an interview appointment with Tengai. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores. Tengai then makes a first selection of promising candidates. The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation.  The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment. According to one of the directors of the municipality, the Tengai robot has made the selection and hiring processes faster, cheaper and more unbiased, freeing up crucial resources to be spent on other tasks.

The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.   Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions.  However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme.
