The AI is a computer program developed by a local company which allows for real-time information regarding the levels of attendance at beaches to be analysed in order to avoid crowds and minimise the risk of possible Covid-19 infections. This software works by using artificial intelligence sensors that are installed in streetlights. From there, virtual grids are created in which there is a maximum capacity for occupants. Alongside this, the 3D volume of people entering and leaving these spaces is measured, as well as the amount of people entering the measurement grids. The results of the calculations are also carried out in real time in order to warn citizens about means of occupancy through the use of percentages and colours.",Local,Spain,Municipality of Fuengirola,Governmental,2021/01/01,yes,,Recreation - culture and religion,Recreational and sporting services.,no,no,Computer Vision and Identity Recognition,Unknown,Incremental / Technical Change
241,Automated social wefare decisions,Adjudication,https://valcon.com/insights/trelleborg-robotics-solution/,,"Trelleborg is Sweden’s front-runner in automating welfare distribution. Three years ago, it became the first municipality to introduce fully automated decision-making in its social services. They named their robot Ernst and introduced it as a digital co-worker. Trelleborg uses robotic automation, or RPA, to handle applications for financial aid. The software is based on different rules that lead to a yes or no decision. The first time Trelleborg residents apply for financial aid, they meet a caseworker in person. After that, they must reapply every month, and if they apply online, the decision will be made by a machine. They fill in details on their income and expenses, which the RPA compares with the previous month. It also pulls information such as tax and income statements and student loans from a database that gathers personal data from seven agencies, for controlling purposes. A decision is then made based on these data points. Should the applicant’s situation significantly change from one month to the next, the software stops and forwards the application to a human caseworker. Around one in three reapplications are currently handled by the software. The rest is treated by caseworkers because of circumstances the software cannot handle.",Local,Sweden,Municipality of Trelleborg,Governmental,2021/01/01,yes,,Health,Social exclusion n.e.c.,no,no,Cognitive Robotics and Process Automation - Connected and Automated Vehicles,Unknown,Organizational / Sustained Change
