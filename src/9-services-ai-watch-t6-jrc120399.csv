Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents.

Beginning this fall, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration will test a new, data-driven method for assigning asylum seekers to cantons across the country. Asylum seekers in the pilot program will be assessed by an algorithm designed to maximize their chances of finding a job.   The algorithm will allow officials to send individuals to the canton that best fits their profile, rather than allocate them randomly, as under the current system.  The program will then follow these asylum seekers over the next several years, comparing their employment rates to those of others who entered the country at the same time. It will include two thousand people, half placed in cantons with the guidance of the algorithm and half placed randomly.   The algorithm’s recommendations take into account constraints such as the limited space in a canton, and placement officials make the final decision in each case.  The placement algorithm was developed by the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL), which has branches at Stanford University and ETH Zurich, and an affiliated researcher from Dartmouth College. IPL researchers aimed to give countries around the world a tool to improve refugee integration that could easily be implemented, at low cost and without overhauling their existing systems.

Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like.The result was information with a near 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all.

The software is based on different rules that lead to a yes or no decision. The first time Trelleborg residents apply for financial aid, they meet a caseworker in person. After that, they must reapply every month, and if they apply online, the decision will be made by a machine. They fill in details on their income and expenses, which the RPA compares with the previous month. It also pulls information such as tax and income statements and student loans from a database that gathers personal data from seven agencies, for controlling purposes. A decision is then made based on these data points. Should the applicant’s situation significantly change from one month to the next, the software stops and forwards the application to a human caseworker.
