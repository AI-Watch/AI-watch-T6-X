AI Watch - Artificial Intelligence in public services. Overview of the use and impact of AI in public services in the EU,"This report is published in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge service to monitor the development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe, launched in December 2018 as part of the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of AI Made in Europe. The report presents the results of the mapping of the use of AI in support of public services in the EU. The analysis serves to contribute landscaping the current state of the art in the field, and provide a preliminary overview of Member States efforts to integrate AI in their government operations and adopt AI-enabled innovations in the public sector. From the analysis it emerges that the interest on the use of AI within governments to support redesigning governance processes and policy-making mechanisms, as well as to improve public services delivery and engagement with citizens is growing. Governments across the EU are exploring the potential of AI use to improve policy design and evaluation, while reorganising the internal management of public administrations at all levels. Indeed, when used in a responsible way, the combination of new, large data sources with advanced machine learning algorithms could radically improve the operating methods of the public sector, thus paving the way to pro-active public service delivery models and relieving resource constrained organisations from mundane and repetitive tasks.",,https://doi.org/10.2760/039619,European Commission,European Union,Desk research

Joinup - Architecture for public services chatbots,"To facilitate the access of citizens and business to public services, a large number of e-catalogues and e-Government portals have been implemented throughout Europe. In many cases the development of these catalogues has not been harmonised. This makes it difficult for public administrations, citizens and businesses to have an integrated view on life events, business events and the public services provided within a specific country or region. In this context, this document aims to identify how public administrations can best provide public services via chatbots.

Mobile contact tracing apps in EU Member States,"Contact tracing and warning apps can be voluntarily installed and used to warn users if they have been in the proximity of a person who is reported to have been tested positive for coronavirus. In the case of an alert, the app may provide relevant information from health authorities, such as advice to get tested or to self-isolate, and who to contact. Mobile contact tracing apps can help speed up traditional contact tracing and save precious hours of work for public health staff tracing the chain of infection.",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/mobile-contact-tracing-apps-eu-member-states_en,European Commission,European Union,Catalogue
