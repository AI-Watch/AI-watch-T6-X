        "description": "In early 2018, the Irish Revenue Commissioners began investigating the potential of Artificial Intelligence to provide a more efficient, effective experience for customers using their telephony services. A pilot project was initiated to examine if AI based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies could be used to deliver an improved customer service, reduce costs and increase efficiencies.    This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) or voicebot which was designed to focus on a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. On a daily basis, taxpayers contact Irish Revenue tax clearance customer support asking how to apply for tax clearance; enquiring what their current tax clearance status is; requesting more information on expired, refused & rescinded tax clearance applications as well as just looking for information on tax clearance itself. The Irish Revenue demonstrated that voicebot technology can offer a fully automated service, providing an efficient, effective experience for customers .https:\/\/www.ops2020.gov.ie\/actions\/innovating-for-our-future\/innovation\/emerging-technology\/artificial-intelligence\/revenue-chatbot\/     Up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot.  70% of first-time applicants engaged with the voicebot when submitting their application.  75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN).  Only 10% of calls were transferred due to failure to understand.",

        "description": "Using a prototype, the city of St.Gallen tested the potential and acceptance of a chatbot in order to offer residents and tourism better access to information and services from the administration.   By the end of 2018, various topics had been mapped in the chatbot. This includes the event calendar, information on parking spaces, the query of mobility information, the use of eUmzugCH, the query of information on disposal and the input of feedback to the programmers.   The implementation in its own software environment, more extensive dialog options, the connection to the residence confirmation, the debt enforcement register extract and the extension of the deadline in the area of \u200b\u200btaxes will take place in 2019. Linked to this is the public test of the chatbot and subsequently a revision based on the knowledge gained from the public test. https:\/\/www.egovernment.ch\/de\/dokumentation\/webpublikation\/projekte\/leistungen-fur-die-bevolkerung\/chatbot-fur-die-offentliche-verwaltung\/     The bot will be integrated in the urban app (mobileSG) and on the city's website towards the end of 2019.     In addition to low-threshold access to basic administrative services, the chatbot project in particular made it possible to open up existing systems and specialist procedures and to provide interfaces for scalable use of the bot in other cities and municipalities.",

        "description": "The densely connected road network in the Netherlands is severely impacted by road accidents with high human, economic and environmental consequences. Road accidents result in 600 deaths per year, and traffic jams that may result from accidents cause an estimated \u20ac 2.7 billion loss in productivity per year. The division of the Netherlands Ministry of Water and Infrastructure Management, Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) operates a 24 hour incident management service to ensure the safety and mobility of emergency response workers, and to regulate and restore traffic flow in the event of an accident.    The growing number of accidents in the Netherlands highways is creating increased pressure on traffic managers and inspectors. Traffic managers must process real-time data from 15+ screens, increasing the chances of an accident being missed. Traffic inspectors need to ensure they are optimally positioned in their deployment zone to minimize travel time to accident sites.    This year Data Science for Social Good has been working with Rijkswaterstaat to create a machine learning model using data from incidents recorded between 2012 to 2016, road characteristics, speed and flow traffic data and weather data. The model predicts within a given time window and road segment the probability of an accident. Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents. This will allow them to better allocate inspectors to road sections to patrol. Using this model gives a 3 to 4 times improvement on a baseline, where traffic inspectors patrol random road segments.",

The system searches for crimes that show a pattern - for example, bicycle thefts in a certain neighborhood happen most often between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and midnight. Based on that, the police can better deploy available resources to fight these crimes more effectively, according to the news wire.",

Using automatic text analysis and advanced machine learning techniques, the tool is said to have identified false robbery reports with over 80 per cent accuracy.    The tool has now been rolled out across Spain to help support police officers and indicate where further investigations are necessary.    VeriPol is specific to reports of robbery and can recognise patterns that are more common with false claims, such as the types of items reported stolen, finer details of incidents and descriptions of a perpetrator.    The research team, which included computer science experts from Cardiff University and Charles III University of Madrid, believe the tool could save the police time and effort by complementing traditional investigative techniques, whilst also deterring people from filing fake statements in the first place.

        "description": "Switzerland is embracing innovation in its response to the global refugee crisis. Beginning this fall, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration will test a new, data-driven method for assigning asylum seekers to cantons across the country. Asylum seekers in the pilot program will be assessed by an algorithm designed to maximize their chances of finding a job.   The algorithm will allow officials to send individuals to the canton that best fits their profile, rather than allocate them randomly, as under the current system.  The program will then follow these asylum seekers over the next several years, comparing their employment rates to those of others who entered the country at the same time. It will include two thousand people, half placed in cantons with the guidance of the algorithm and half placed randomly.   The algorithm\u2019s recommendations take into account constraints such as the limited space in a canton, and placement officials make the final decision in each case.  The placement algorithm was developed by the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL), which has branches at Stanford University and ETH Zurich, and an affiliated researcher from Dartmouth College. IPL researchers aimed to give countries around the world a tool to improve refugee integration that could easily be implemented, at low cost and without overhauling their existing systems. Their first step: harnessing many years of underused data on refugees and their outcomes. https:\/\/www.srf.ch\/news\/schweiz\/jobs-fuer-fluechtlinge-algorithmus-verteilt-neu-asylbewerber-auf-kantone",

        "description": "The Tallinn transport department, responsible for organising public transport and traffic in Tallinn, started developing a machine vision application in autumn 2018 in collaboration with Sifr O\u00dc. The main objective of this application is to identify the traffic load within Tallinn, i.e. how many cars drive in and out of the city in a day in order to make city transport planning related decisions based on such data (e.g. parking issues, road construction, etc.). Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like.The result was information with a near 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all. The accuracy of the results is affected by weather conditions, dirt on the camera lens, etc. Regardless, the results are a valuable milestone for the city for expanding the use of machine vision to other hundreds of city traffic cameras.",

A virtual assistant, UNA, has been developed in the framework of a pilot project in seven months, with five team members. The Enterprise Register, when implementing a virtual assistant project, makes communication with the customer more accessible and friendly, does not require customers to go face-to-face to customer service centers, saving their time and money, without having to wait for a conversation with the Enterprise Register operator in the call center, because answers to customer questions are provided immediately. A virtual assistant to the Enterprise Register also enables employees of the institution to replace technical routine work, allowing employees to focus on higher added-value work, where, for example, emotional engagement is also needed, which the virtual assistant cannot replace.",

FITS LABS provides uniform management and processing of sensors and data in the transport sector, taking advantage of the latest cloud computing and MI. As part of the project, data collected by various sensors from many manufacturers is collected in one place. Collecting and managing them teaches your computer to \u201cunderstand\u201d transport flows and events. For example, in photographs provided by Latvian speed cameras, identify vehicles by identifying their characteristics, recognizing the number marks, etc.At the end of 2018, the number of road accidents decreased by 43% compared to the number prior to the installation of photo cameras (1 084, after 613) at the roadside stages where photo cameras were installed and operated. On the other hand, the number of road deaths decreased by 87% (32 people died before the accounting period, 4 during the photo radar period). In the country as a whole, the number of road deaths has decreased from 184 to 148 since 2014, i.e. by 20%. During this period, traffic intensity has increased by 15-20% on the national road network. According to the Latvian Vehicle Insurers Bureau (\u201cLTAB\u201d), the creation of a network of photo radars throughout Latvia is an effective tool to limit speeding in daily life, thereby also contributing to improving traffic safety. A survey conducted by the LTAB concluded that 30% of drivers who prefer to exceed the speed limit are reducing it before photo radars. It should be noted that the introduction of photo radars is not the only factor that has a positive impact on changes in road safety.",

Rotterdam has a unique roof landscape that was created after World War II, where many buildings with flat roofs were built during the city\u2019s reconstruction. There are approximately 14.5km2 of flat roofs in the city and the Municipality of Rotterdam wants to use data to make informed decisions regarding the sustainable usage of its rooftops.  DSSG (Data Science for Social Good) is helping Rotterdam figure out how improved use of its rooftops could help address challenges with water storage, green spaces and energy generation. The principal goal will be to use aerial and satellite images to identify the current usage of rooftops in Rotterdam.",

Two cities involved (Tampere and Turku) carried out well-being surveys among its student populations, and - based on its results - clustered the students into the groups in need of different support. The study has discovered that factors such as reliability of the public transportation, and quality of the natural environment plays an important role in students\u2019 well-being. Data retrieved from the study helped create a new cross-cutting public offering - a bot that would supply information about the topics that students found important. The uptake of the new service has been lackluster, leading the authorities to believe that only proactive marketing could change customers\u2019 behaviour. At the same time, it has been concluded that in order to pursue such projects further, municipalities need to develop user experience awareness and data analytics skills.",

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline.

An analysis of the system\u2019s source code brought little transparency \u2013 but revealed that the personal data of hundreds was wrongly made public. Trelleborg is a city of 40,000 in Sweden\u2019s far south. Three years ago, it became the first municipality to introduce fully automated decision-making in its social services. They named their robot Ernst and introduced it as a digital co-worker.Trelleborg uses a process known as robotic automation, or RPA, to handle applications for financial aid. The software is based on different rules that lead to a yes or no decision. The first time Trelleborg residents apply for financial aid, they meet a caseworker in person. After that, they must reapply every month, and if they apply online, the decision will be made by a machine. They fill in details on their income and expenses, which the RPA compares with the previous month. It also pulls information such as tax and income statements and student loans from a database that gathers personal data from seven agencies, for controlling purposes. A decision is then made based on these data points. Should the applicant\u2019s situation significantly change from one month to the next, the software stops and forwards the application to a human caseworker. Around one in three reapplications are currently handled by the software. The rest is treated by caseworkers because of circumstances the software cannot handle.",
