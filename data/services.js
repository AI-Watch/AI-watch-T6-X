Technically, chatbot retrieves information e.g. relevant City of Oulu websites, chat history, guidance information, databases, and other information sources. OuluBot is available 24\/7 service. independent of working hours. If the user is looking for information that OuluBot would not be able to answer, then during office hours the discussion could be directed to the City of Oulu chat service (Oulu10 general counseling customer service).",

A pilot project was initiated to examine if AI based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies could be used to deliver an improved customer service, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) or voicebot which was designed to focus on a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. On a daily basis, taxpayers contact Irish Revenue tax clearance customer support asking how to apply for tax clearance; enquiring what their current tax clearance status is; requesting more information on expired, refused & rescinded tax clearance applications as well as just looking for information on tax clearance itself. It is reported that currently, up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot,  70% of first-time applicants engaged with the voicebot when submitting their application, 75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN). Only in 10% of the calls, the calls were transferred to a human operator due to the inability of the voicebot to understand the request.",

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline. The government intends to add more functionality to the app over time.",

This Chatbot was named Taxana, chosen by the employees of the financial administration combining the English word tax and the Slovak word toy. The system has been put in place as it is argued that the state financial management must continue to digitize and electronic processes to make the processes easier for taxpayers. The introduction of automated chat in communication with our clients will also assist the call center staff, who save time and can thus deal with more complex issues of taxpayers.",

This software works by using artificial intelligence sensors that are installed in streetlights. From there, virtual grids are created in which there is a maximum capacity for occupants. Alongside this, the 3D volume of people entering and leaving these spaces is measured, as well as the amount of people entering the measurement grids. The results of the calculations are also carried out in real time in order to warn citizens about means of occupancy through the use of percentages and colours.",

Three years ago, it became the first municipality to introduce fully automated decision-making in its social services. They named their robot Ernst and introduced it as a digital co-worker. Trelleborg uses robotic automation, or RPA, to handle applications for financial aid. The software is based on different rules that lead to a yes or no decision. The first time Trelleborg residents apply for financial aid, they meet a caseworker in person. After that, they must reapply every month, and if they apply online, the decision will be made by a machine. They fill in details on their income and expenses, which the RPA compares with the previous month. It also pulls information such as tax and income statements and student loans from a database that gathers personal data from seven agencies, for controlling purposes. A decision is then made based on these data points. Should the applicant\u2019s situation significantly change from one month to the next, the software stops and forwards the application to a human caseworker. Around one in three reapplications are currently handled by the software. The rest is treated by caseworkers because of circumstances the software cannot handle.",
