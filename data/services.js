In 2016 the voucher system in Groningen was moved to a blockchain, developed by DutchChain, a technology provider company. The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits. Smart vouchers can be used, for example, in sport clubs, cinemas or for subsidization of solar panels for home owners. From the municipality perspective Stadjerspas ensures that public money reserved for a specified purpose is spent exclusively on that purpose and targeted at a desired group of beneficiaries.",

In 2005, Estonia became the first country in the world to hold nation-wide elections using this method, and in 2007, it made headlines as the first country to use i-Voting in parliamentary elections. Internet voting, or i-Voting, is a system that allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world. Completely unrelated to the electronic voting systems used elsewhere, which involve costly and problematic machinery, the Estonian solution is simple, elegant and secure. During a designated pre-voting period, the voter logs onto the system using an ID-card or Mobile-ID, and casts a ballot. The voter\u2019s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity. With any method of remote voting, including traditional postal ballots, the possibility of votes being forced or bought is a concern. Estonia\u2019s solution was to allow voters to log on and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period. Since each vote cancels the last, a voter always has the option of changing his or her vote later. In the case of i-Voting, the cumulative time saved in the last Estonian elections was 11,000 working days.",

Furthermore, each citizen would have control over which data he would share with whom (for obvious reasons, the exceptions can be made for governmental organisations).

Healthcare providers don\u2019t always know each other or aren\u2019t aware of specific arrangements. The Healthcare Institute sees Blockchain as a technology that can create a clear overview of authorisations in the healthcare process. It has developed a prototype on Ethereum, which allows involved healthcare providers to get real time information on a need to know basis about their client\/ patient. The client\/patient has more control over his data and can determine - via an application - which professional can get access to additional information.",

The Department does not only register ownership of real estate, but also registers and provides geo-information data. Sometimes the data is used in the wrong context, or an outdated set is accidentally used. By applying the blockchain, the Kadaster can immediately specify the most up-to-date dataset by means of a timestamp. It can then be used when filling in a form for environmental law requirements as well as other use cases. All participants can then establish that the data is up-to-date and correct. Providing these open data sets within the blockchain is not a very complicated process, but is therefore suitable to use to build a first blockchain prototype. The Kadaster is also researching work from other countries that are already experimenting with the blockchain and is looking to apply certain elements in the Netherlands.",

        "description": "The municipalities of Barendrecht, Albrandswaard and Ridderkerk's BAR Organization looked into ways in which they could apply blockchain to various permitting processes such as street parties. The BAR organization looked at small-scale events where someone applies for a license for a street party. Currently, the permit application is submitted to the municipality, but must be checked by several authorities, such as the fire department or police to approve or deny the permit based on feasibility. All these control moments and advice are again collected by the municipality and then it is checked whether the event permit can be issued. With the pilot team and experts, the BAR organization tried to model this process on the blockchain automating standard procedures with smart contracts. An additional advantage is that all involved agencies are now also immediately aware of each other's advice and any objections, without intervention of the municipality. Both matters mean a huge reduction in the burden on the work within the municipality. Everything can be done faster and the procedure becomes less vulnerable because a large part of the communication is no longer necessary.",

        "description": "Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) is investigating how digital identity can be implemented on blockchains for Dutch citizens According to RvIG, a reliable, easy-to-use digital identity is a prerequisite for being able to participate in the blockchain. There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases. The marriage could thus be completed via the blockchain.",

        "description": "The municipality of Zuidhorn has found a unique and innovative way to implement the Kindpakket subsidies via blockchain technology. The Child Package is a budget for children of parents with a minimum income. In the municipality of Zuidhorn about 150 children are eligible for the program. This money is used by the municipality for disadvantaged children, giving them the opportunity to participate in social activities, in sports and cultural activities at school. The municipality carries out this national assignment with local entrepreneurs and associations. Within the city, two students have been engaged in research into the possible applications of blockchain in municipal services. They have designed the implementation of the Kindpakket in a new and very user-friendly way with blockchain. The recipient of the Kindpakket can take out the purchase in a simple administrative and financial manner. The 'customer' pays, for example buying a bicycle, with a specific code and the entrepreneur gets the money directly into his account with no intervention from the municipality.",

        "description": "Novel payment models will enable HM Treasury (HMT) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to distribute welfare support more efficiently and improve policy delivery. By applying DLTs in the registration and payment processes for government grants and benefits, DWP will be better equipped to: (1) Prevent financial losses through fraud and error, (2) Support the most vulnerable citizens by offering them the benefits of full financial inclusion, (3) Support the achievement of the government\u2019s wider policy objectives, especially getting people out of poverty in a sustainable way and (4) Offer good value for money and place public expenditure on a sustainable footing. A large number of welfare claimants are un- or under-banked and face barriers to greater financial inclusion such as credit checks, access to traditional financial products, and the costs of unauthorised transactions. DLTs offer a cheap and supportive means of getting these claimants into the benefits system. Digital identities could be confirmed through distributed ledgers running on securely-encoded devices \u2014 or even through software on a mobile device \u2014 which would allow end-users to receive benefits directly, at reduced transaction costs to banks or local authorities. This may allow them to become more fully included in the financial system through a secure distribution point that is more reliable than a bank account. Such a solution could also be linked with other systems to reduce the level of fraud and official error in the delivery of benefits, as identities would be more difficult to forge. Such activities may help to achieve one of the DWP\u2019s principal policy objectives: to lift people sustainably out of the cycle of poverty and state dependence. Through the innovative application of such technologies, it would be possible \u2014 with agreement from the benefit claimant in question \u2014 to set rules at both the recipient and merchant ends of welfare transactions. This may present the opportunity for ministers to consider options for achieving better policy outcomes from the distribution of welfare support by agreeing or setting rules around the use of benefits.",

It identified five key strategic drivers for the new RTGS system in a consultation document, \"A new RTGS service for the U.K.: safeguarding stability, enabling innovation,\" published Friday. Among them, it lists the need to interface with new technologies such as distributed ledgers. These are often referred to as blockchains, and include systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the bank's view, these systems -- and, indeed, the entire concept of distributed ledgers -- are still in their infancy, but if they achieve critical mass, it wants to be ready for them.",

The Federal Government\u2019s Finance Agency (OeBFA) has assigned banking giant Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB) to carry out the auction on its behalf. The bank\u2019s responsibilities will include deploying the notarization service to authenticate auction transaction data and subsequently store it on the blockchain, the agency explained.\u201cBlockchain technology offers great potential for increasing efficiency and ensuring the quality of bank processes. Therefore, we have been dealing with this topic intensively for some time now and have already tested several prototypes. Starting the real operation on behalf of OeBFA is a pleasing and logical next step.\u201d",

The platform is the first worldwide example in use of public Blockchain , applied to the wine sector on ministerial data. The solution, in fact, unlike other products placed on the market, makes available information relating to Italian wines already present in the Public Administration servers, that is the data of the Sian, National Agricultural Information System, supplied by all the players in the supply chain.",

A major way in which blockchain technology is estimated to save costs is through reducing dependence on document-based transactions. As procurement is one of the major functions of government departments, and also a document-intensive process, applications for the technology in procurement may be identified.",

Each municipality would be able to launch requests for tenders in the form of a smart contract. Potential suppliers can respond with their tenders (probably also in the form of a smart contract). Under this system, an automatic matching would be done between the requirements of the request for tender and the supplier's offer. The qualification\/disqualification process can be automated (and the buyer will not be able to see the price offer if the supplier is disqualified). The evaluation process could also be automated.

The first step is to test this concept, through a first pilot due this year. The idea is that eventually this data can be used to help automate various parts of the procurement process. One initial hypotheses on how this could be done is automated categorisation of the product types that are being procured.

Each day, the results of its analysis are sent to TCU auditors by email, with the system flagging any abnormalities about the bids, for example requiring participants to obtain certificates that the TCU does not consider to be prerequisites.\n\nMeanwhile, MONICA is a panel providing the visualisation of public purchasing data, such as the suppliers that are most contracted and the types of service most used. Finally SOFIA is a tool that analyses the reports developed by auditors. It points out errors and suggests correlations and reference sources.",

The model is applied to Spanish provinces in which actual cases of corruption were reported by the media or went to court between 2000 and 2012. The model finds that the taxation of real estate, economic growth, the increase in real estate prices, the growing number of deposit institutions and nonfinancial firms, and the same political party remaining in power for long periods seem to induce public corruption",

The system is well used in cities; however the algorithm does not yet work well in rural areas. \nThe Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm. \nEstonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control. \nIn line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia\u2019s economy and state.",
