To do this, they compare the text of the files of the offer to the ones of the metadata of the components.

        "description": "Digital participation platforms are important tools for increasing citizen engagement and improving government responsiveness. However, analysing the high volumes of citizen input collected on these platforms is extremely time-consuming and daunting for city officials; this technical difficulty can keep them from uncovering valuable learnings. Setting up a digital participation platform therefore isn\u2019t enough: it\u2019s also necessary to make data analysis more accessible so that civil servants can tap into collective intelligence and make better informed decisions. The challenge of automation that has been faced with, by the civic tech company developing this solution, is shared by the public sector at large. CitizenLab aims to bridge the knowledge gap that currently exists in the public sector.The platform administrators have access to all of this information at a glance in intelligent, real- time dashboards. The topic modelling makes it easy to see what the citizen\u2019s priorities are, and to make decisions accordingly. The CitizenLab Platform is in use in many local authorities which are likely to use some of the elements of the AI to analyse volumes of citizen input.  The main challenge in citizen participation projects isn\u2019t to collect citizens\u2019 input: it\u2019s to analyse it. Overworked and under-resourced administrations often lack the time and technical skills to process the contributions; as a result, valuable insights get lost in the process. By helping administrations effortlessly process citizen input and extract the key ideas,  the  NLP technology has been integrated to the CitizenLab platform, therefore giving civil servants a centralised place to gather, moderate and analyse citizens\u2019 ideas.

        "description": "Natural Language Processing (understanding spoken language) is used to automatically classify incoming telephone questions at the 1700 (Flemish Infoline), to integrally transcribe and document the conversations, and to suggest answers.  With this project, Informatie Vlaanderen wants to optimise the operation of the Flemish Information Line with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Concretely, the project wants to detect and categorise the incoming questions faster and more 'finely-meshed', and also integrate this 'finely-meshed' into the editorial management. In this way, the answers can be suggested more quickly, more adequately and also more 'automatically' to the answer provider, regardless of the chosen communication channel (oral or written). To this end, the project aims to harness the broad potential of AI, with emphasis on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), and language and speech technology (Speech-to-Text [STT] and Text-to-Speech [TTS]).  By using AI modules, the project wants to interpret and also 'manipulate' the question\/answer process of the Flemish Infoline in order to make the whole process more efficient and automatic, using all the implicit knowledge present in the process. In essence, the project aims at two objectives: (1) the quicker and more efficient capturing and categorising of the question, and (2) the quicker and more efficient forwarding of the 'correctly captioned' question to the 'correct' answer provider with the 'correct' skills, whereby a valid and standardised answer (suggestion) is immediately sent along with it (so that the answer provider does not have to look up the intended answer script).",

The Child and Family agency does not carry out the inspections itself but works together with the Regional Health Care Inspection Unit of the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family.  However, there is limited capacity available to conduct all the inspections. For a long period of time, there has been an interest to figure out how to optimise the inspection capacity. The use of data had been considered as way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors. The predictive system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGBoost) to analyse various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection Unit. Combining the recommendations of the predictive system with existing staff experience and expertise enables more targeted and data-driven interventions.",

        "description": "In 2015, the Estonian Health Insurance Fund started cooperating with the World Bank to develop and pilot a risk-based management model that would help increase the integration of health services. With risk-based management, GPs can identify patients with multiple chronic diseases on their list for whom additional prevention, counseling and monitoring would be most beneficial to their health and quality of life. If these patients are neglected by the GP teams, this can lead to serious problems, including unnecessary deterioration in health, which not only causes health damage but also unnecessary costs to the healthcare system (avoidable hospitalizations, duplication of examinations, etc.).  The created solution finds the best algorithm for predicting which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be hospitalized. In the solution, the EHIF database of medical bills first finds certain conditions \/ diagnoses to be included in the algorithm. Different models have their own strengths, but the differences should not be big.   The results of the solution are comparable to the results of research presented in the literature: John Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (the leading proprietary risk stratification tool) - Haas et al .; Risk-Stratification Methods for Identifying Patients for Care Coordination; The American Journal of Managed Care (September 2013).   The machine learning model is better than the old mechanical model in finding patients at risk.  The solution makes it possible to create a practical model for GP centers to predict which patients are more likely to end up in hospital or at other health risks.",

This system, called SATIKAS , uses deep learning methods and convolutional neural network approaches to analyse the satellite data coming from the European COPERNICUS programme to automatically detect whether mowing has taken place on the Estonian grasslands. The optical satellite images from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the government in Estonia. The SATIKAS system is still under development and will expand its features and capabilities in the near future. While at the moment the system is able to detect mowing of grass, in the future it will be used for identifying different types of crops and trees as well.",

        "description": "The Tallinn transport department, responsible for organising public transport and traffic in Tallinn, started developing a machine vision application in autumn 2018 in collaboration with Sifr O\u00dc. The main objective of this application is to identify the traffic load within Tallinn, i.e. how many cars drive in and out of the city in a day in order to make city transport planning related decisions based on such data (e.g. parking issues, road construction, etc.). Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like.The result was information with a near 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all. The accuracy of the results is affected by weather conditions, dirt on the camera lens, etc. Regardless, the results are a valuable milestone for the city for expanding the use of machine vision to other hundreds of city traffic cameras.",

        "description": "France has authorised the use of surveillance cameras to monitor whether passengers on public transport are abiding by the requirement to wear masks. However, France\u2019s data protection watchdog CNIL called out the practice, saying it was not governed by any legal framework and was therefore illegal. It\u2019s part of the city\u2019s efforts to end lockdown and help prevent the spread of Covid-19, but it\u2019s raised concerns from the government\u2019s privacy watchdog. The authority began a three-month test of its software from French tech company Datakalab this week at the Chatelet-Les-Halles station in the heart of Paris, normally used by about 33 million passengers per year. Monitors will have access to a dashboard with the proportion of riders believed to be wearing masks. France planned to make mask wearing mandatory in public transportation from May 11 2019 as it planned to ease lockdown measures. The AI was regarded to be able to supplement enforcement agents in stations. Still, CNIL, the government body in charge of privacy, raised concerns that this type of technology carries a risk that the identity of the people being analyzed could be reconstructed. The measures would also qualify under Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation because the cameras will be collecting people\u2019s personal data. The project has been terminated earlier due to ethical concerns and the impossiblity to oppose the results of the system. https:\/\/www.bfmtv.com\/tech\/trop-intrusives-les-cameras-de-detection-de-masques-desactivees-a-paris-et-a-cannes_AN-202006220163.html",

The objective is to dynamically detect 2 to 5 new SMEs per month on the scale of Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9. Expected impacts in terms of digital transformation: an even more effective decentralized State action to support weakened companies. Ultimately, it is a real \u201csecure social network\u201d centered on the company which will become the daily tool of public actors mobilized around companies in difficulty.

The bureaucratic burden is increased by the fact that documents are requested at different places in a redundant manner and that there is usually (still) no electronic data exchange. Immediately after the birth, this creates additional work for many parents - in addition to the often tense domestic situation.  The guiding principle of the project is: \"The data runs, not the parents\". First, in 2018, a citizen-friendly, only three-page combination form was developed for entering all necessary data once. Thanks to a cross-institutional parents can hand it in directly at the maternity clinic, and the cooperation partners take care of everything else. take care of everything else. Parents now receive their child's birth certificate by post much faster. The parents now receive their child's birth certificate, the tax ID, the entry in the registration system and the child benefit notice much more quickly by post.

On this basis, an online service was service was developed in 2019, which will initially be offered as a pilot to a limited target group in June 2020. at the Asklepios Clinic in Altona.

The Dublin Beat can help local authorities to better understand how citizens feel about key issues and ensure that civic efforts and policy reflect the needs of communities. But of course, it is important to note that these insights are indicative only of the sentiments expressed by a cohort of citizens who use social media. Local authorities employ other methods to ensure truly inclusive citizen engagement.",

        "description": "In early 2018, the Irish Revenue Commissioners began investigating the potential of Artificial Intelligence to provide a more efficient, effective experience for customers using their telephony services. A pilot project was initiated to examine if AI based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies could be used to deliver an improved customer service, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) or voicebot which was designed to focus on a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. On a daily basis, taxpayers contact Irish Revenue tax clearance customer support asking how to apply for tax clearance; enquiring what their current tax clearance status is; requesting more information on expired, refused & rescinded tax clearance applications as well as just looking for information on tax clearance itself. It is reported that currently, up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot,  70% of first-time applicants engaged with the voicebot when submitting their application, 75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN). Only in 10% of the calls, the calls were transferred to a human operator due to the inability of the voicebot to understand the request.",

        "description": "In Latvia, a pilot project for developing lung cancer risk assessment, early diagnosis and forecasting techniques based on large data analysis. Doctors acknowledge that treatment is more effective when it is detected as soon as possible. Over the course of the project, ML is intended to be used to diagnose cancer. In this area, the Latvian Investment and Development Agency (LAA) has approved two strategic commercialisation projects under the \u201cAid for Development of Technology Transfer System\u201d programme for a total amount of EUR 600 thousand. In the event of successful cooperation, a genomics centre may be developed in Latvia, with the necessary technical and research infrastructure, which, using data stored in the \u201cdata lake\u201d (data lake), would be able to achieve European excellence in applied research and services. In turn, the genomics centre would result in new and unique data.",

Chatbots are available 24\/7 and thus able to make communication between citizens and the state accessible and friendly. UNA is available on both the website of the Register of Enterprises as well as on the Facebook page as part of the Facebook messenger application. UNA is able to answer frequently asked questions about the registration of their businesses as well as the liquidation, merchants, companies and organizations. If citizens already have an application in progress, they are also able to ask about the progress of their documents. At the moment, UNA only works in the Latvian language.  A Latvian company, Tilde, specializing in AI technologies cooperated in the development of UNA. The usage of the conversational agent has been argued to be highly successful and has been nominated for numerous awards such as the OECD's Public Excellence, World Summit Awards and others. According to the first performance indicators, 44% of the questions asked on UNA are considered to be general of nature and easily taken care of by the Chatbot.",

        "description": "The densely connected road network in the Netherlands is severely impacted by road accidents with high human, economic and environmental consequences. Road accidents result in 600 deaths per year, and traffic jams that may result from accidents cause an estimated \u20ac 2.7 billion loss in productivity per year. The division of the Netherlands Ministry of Water and Infrastructure Management, Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) operates a 24 hour incident management service to ensure the safety and mobility of emergency response workers, and to regulate and restore traffic flow in the event of an accident.  The growing number of accidents in the Netherlands highways is creating increased pressure on traffic managers and inspectors. Traffic managers must process real-time data from 15+ screens, increasing the chances of an accident being missed. Traffic inspectors need to ensure they are optimally positioned in their deployment zone to minimize travel time to accident sites.  This year Data Science for Social Good has been working with Rijkswaterstaat to create a machine learning model using data from incidents recorded between 2012 to 2016, road characteristics, speed and flow traffic data and weather data. The model predicts within a given time window and road segment the probability of an accident. Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents. This will allow them to better allocate inspectors to road sections to patrol. Using this model gives a 3 to 4 times improvement on a baseline, where traffic inspectors patrol random road segments.",

        "description": "In the city of Amsterdam, a pilot is being carried out which uses AI and algorithms to track down people illegally renting out their homes via platforms, such as Airbnb. Housing fraud is an increasingly big issue in the city of Amsterdam according to the Court of Audit of Amsterdam, leading to harms of the neighbourhood.  The algorithm will include information about previous housing fraud, information from the city\u2019s population registries and building data from the city\u2019s registry of addresses and buildings. While this information is also usable for analysis by civil servants themselves, the use of the AI system is expected will speed up the process significantly and enable more accurate responses as it can connect multiple factors together in ways civil servants themselves would not be able to.  According to the AI registry of the city of Amsterdam, once a new report has been received in which a rental is suspected of illegal holiday rental, a probability based on a random forest regression is generated resulting in either a high or low suspicion of fraud, based on a combination of different values.  If the probability of housing fraud that rolls out of the algorithm is higher than 50 percent, an employee can prioritize the address for a field investigation. The city mentions however, that the tackling of fraud remains human work and the algorithm will not make decisions, merely recommendations. The civil staff will have to decide whether to investigate an address further, by combining their expertise and the algorithm predictions. The AI system will provide a visualization of the risk assessment and consequently on the basis which data plays a role in the recommendation and which does not. Furthermore, the system does not in the end decide if fraud has taken place, as this is the responsibility of the department. To this end, the AI system merely acts as a first recommendation in the process of determining if housing frauds take place. It is expected that the use of the AI system is to optimize the limited inspection capacity of the city in the most efficient and effective matter, so that field investigations are conducted in premises where fraud is indeed more like. However, there are many risks to public value destruction, of which the city is already aware of. Therefore, personal data such as birth, nationality and others are not included in the algorithm, limiting prejudice of the algorithm to a certain demographic or increasing privacy concerns.  Furthermore, even when personal information is not used, it may occur that the AI indirectly leads to targeting certain neighbourhoods more often, potentially leading to discriminatory recommendations. Therefore, the city of Amsterdam is conducting ongoing research to tackle this form of unintended algorithmic bias during the pilot, highlighting that the increase of efficiency may lead to more discriminatory services as calculations are based on correlations and not causations.",

        "description": "Various municipalities in the Netherlands have been using the SyRi system to detect welfare fraud more effectively. SyRi has been developed by the Dutch government and uses various risk indicators from existing governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more, in order to detect which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. To enable the sharing of different information items that are relevant for SyRi, the system operates on a legal basis which clearly indicates which kind of data can be captured, stored and shared.The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations.   Various organisations have opposed the usage of the system. They argue that it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. The UN-rapporteur for Human Rights also expressed his concerns on the use of SyRi as it could be a significant threat to human rights. Some projects revealed significant difficulties in integrating various data sources, which caused the recommendations by the system to become outdated and in fact unusable. In municipalities where the system actually gave recommendations on possible fraudulent behaviour, the success rate was very low. As, the costs of SyRi have been estimated to be over 325.000 euro per year, so that many have been wondering whether the system was worth the privacy and financial costs at all.   Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR (European Convention of Human Rights), thus its usage has been cancelled. The judge ruled that the collective, economic welfare interest of preventing fraud weighed insufficiently against the social interest of privacy. Furthermore, the absence of disclosure about the inner working of SyRi makes its usage insufficiently transparent and verifiable.",

        "description": "Customers of The Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management (DF\u00d8) spend considerable time and resources on posting incoming invoices due to uncertainty about the correct posting. In some cases this can lead to invoices being paid after the due date and can create extra costs for the agency in the form of interest and charges. DF\u00d8 is currently testing solutions from two companies, one of which involves an accounting robot that uses AI to propose the correct posting. The model is trained using historical data before making a prediction of the posting based on a combination of historical data and information obtained from the actual invoice.",

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline. The government intends to add more functionality to the app over time.",

        "description": "The project, called 'FailStopper' and launched earlier this month, aims, through sensors, to study the compressed air system of the vehicle (installed on the roof) which, according to the researcher, allows the \"performance of the secondary suspension\", an element responsible for \"keeping the vehicle level with station platforms\". Researchers from the Institute of Systems and Computers Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC), in Porto, launched a project that aims to \"combat and anticipate leveling failures\" of Metro do Porto vehicles. The 'FailStopper' project was one of the 15 projects approved in the Scientific Research and Technological Development contest in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration, an initiative of the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) that joins the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and the Ministry of Administrative Modernization.

This software works by using artificial intelligence sensors that are installed in streetlights. Then, virtual grids are created in which there is a maximum capacity for occupants.  The 3D volume of people entering and leaving these spaces is measured, as well as the amount of people entering the measurement grids. The results of the calculations are carried out in real time in order to warn citizens about means of occupancy (percentages and colours are used as visual warnings).",

The Merc\u00e8 project is proposed as a new line of work that applies new machine learning techniques (one of the branches of so-called artificial intelligence) to the disciplines of urban planning, geography, sociology, economics and science. urban health to build objective knowledge and open data about our urban environments. Thus, Merc\u00e8 is a citizen science experiment that aims to involve citizens in the training of an algorithm that allows us to design more livable cities. Through this experiment it is possible to translate the individual perceptions of many citizens about the habitability of cities into objective knowledge, reusable in urban planning. The relevance and innovation of the project is based on applying information and communication technologies to different transversal fields of knowledge, which have their common denominator in the city. The project develops a workflow based on public \/ open data and machine learning techniques to promote algorithmic transparency in data science and citizen participation with great social impact.",

        "description": "The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes. This practice is regarded as quite troublesome, as it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police resources and is often used in combination with other fraudulent behaviour. Recently, the Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol, an AI system in order to detect false police reports. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. Its development was the result of a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff, the Charles III University of Madrid and the Spanish National Police. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers of the universities in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports. VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports. For example, pilot studies found that false police reports are more likely to include shorter statements, focused on the objects which were stolen and lacking details. Following the development, the system was tested in pilot situations in both the police department of Malaga and Murcia. These pilots have been regarded as successful because an increase in the number of false reports was detected. Furthermore, an anonymous survey among the staff showed that the VeriPol system was useful, easy to use but should include more functionalities to detect other forms of crime. Now the system has been rolled out for use by all the departments of the Spanish National Police. The expected impact of the use of the system is to both detect false reports early, leaving more police resources available to focus on other tasks and reports, while at the same time deterring people from filing fake statements in the first place. An additional benefit of the system is to gain more insights into how people lie to police officers as well as to gain more knowledge in detecting true and false police reports.",

        "description": "The Swedish municipality of Upplands-Bro has started experimenting with the robot Tengai in their recruitment processes since June 2019. Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the agency has not used resumes in their recruitment process and growingly taken an interest in data-driven recruitment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot was regarded as the next step in preventing biases in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to neutralise any psycho-social prejudices. The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. For the company this was also a first time, the municipal recruitment and staffing agency being their first public sector client. The Tengai robot is seen to complement the recruitment process nicely, having been designed not to perceive the age, gender, clothing, background or other looks of interviewed persons. The municipality is using Tengai to first identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. Here, Tengai works in collaboration with existing staff, as the recruiters analyse competency checks and schedule an interview appointment with Tengai. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores. Tengai then makes a first selection of promising candidates. The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation. The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment. According to one of the directors of the municipality, the Tengai robot has made the selection and hiring processes faster, cheaper and more unbiased, freeing up crucial resources to be spent on other tasks.",

        "description": "In the municipality of Trelleborg, AI technologies are used to automate various social assistance decisions since 2016. It was the first municipality to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle various applications on social assistance. At the moment, the automated decision making system is able to process applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and has been regarded as a successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits. Previously, employees had to manually assess the applications which took considerable amounts of time and costs. With more than 300 applications on social benefits in the municipality every month, citizens sometimes had to wait an average of 8 days on the decision on their welfare-payments, which sometimes leading up to 20 days. As a result of this waiting time, citizens would frequently contact the department about their applications, further increasing the workload of the staff. The decision to use AI to improve the welfare payment process was thought limit the waiting time and consequently various worries of payment delivery by citizens.  Any rejected applications are still handled by people themselves. The automation of the welfare services was not possible if there was not already an online process for people to submit their welfare applications to. In 2015, Trelleborg was the first Swedish municipality to digitalize their administration on social benefits. Already 75% of the citizens used the online platform to access welfare payments which enabled significant data and information to automate this process with RPA technology. Without the data coming from the self-service portal, it would not have been possible to automate these processes. Valcon, a consultancy, helped to develop and implement the RPA platform. As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration could be allocated to spend more time on other, value adding tasks such as handling more complex cases.",

The implementation in its own software environment, more extensive dialog options, the connection to the residence confirmation, the debt enforcement register extract and the extension of the deadline in the area of \u200b\u200btaxes will take place in 2019. Linked to this is the public test of the chatbot and subsequently a revision based on the knowledge gained from the public test.    The bot will be integrated in the urban app (mobileSG) and on the city's website towards the end of 2019.   In addition to low-threshold access to basic administrative services, the chatbot project in particular made it possible to open up existing systems and specialist procedures and to provide interfaces for scalable use of the bot in other cities and municipalities.",

Beginning this fall, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration will test a new, data-driven method for assigning asylum seekers to cantons across the country. Asylum seekers in the pilot program will be assessed by an algorithm designed to maximize their chances of finding a job.  The algorithm will allow officials to send individuals to the canton that best fits their profile, rather than allocate them randomly, as under the current system. The program will then follow these asylum seekers over the next several years, comparing their employment rates to those of others who entered the country at the same time. It will include two thousand people, half placed in cantons with the guidance of the algorithm and half placed randomly.  The algorithm\u2019s recommendations take into account constraints such as the limited space in a canton, and placement officials make the final decision in each case. The placement algorithm was developed by the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL), which has branches at Stanford University and ETH Zurich, and an affiliated researcher from Dartmouth College. IPL researchers aimed to give countries around the world a tool to improve refugee integration that could easily be implemented, at low cost and without overhauling their existing systems.

        "description": "A predictive system called the \"Early Help Profiling System (EHPS)\" used in Hackney County (London), which uses data from a variety of different sources to identify children and families considered vulnerable and at risk of child abuse to the municipality. The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.   Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme.  Now Hackney Council stopped working with the programme as it did not realise the expected benefits.",
